		<h3 id="History" > Company <strong>History</strong> </h3>
		<p>
		This company was founded in 21<sup> st</sup> January fo 2018 by Vilmar. It is going to be big! Right now, I am here sit in front a computer that I bought in 2012 with a money that I earned from 
		CAPES (That is a brazilian governamental institution) that manager schorlarships for students in Brazil. When I bought this computer I was in France at ISIMA in Clermont-Ferrand doing my first year there.
		CAPES granted us (me and more 7 brazilians) 1 thousand EUR to buy books and computer to be used during our stay. I am very cheap person and I a try to find a good compromisse about quality and price. 
		From my point of view most of the companies invest more money on publicity than in increasing the qualities of their products. Thus, it is not always a good idea to follow the flow. The best thing to do 
		before buying some thing is to answer two questions: What is the real propose of buying it? For how long I am going to use it?. Depend on the answers you decide the price that you are willing to pay.

			<p>
			In fact, I came here because I really like to study. Once, I worked to a company where I kind of earned a lot of money. But I felt a that I was not improving myself 
			actually I was just following rules and being a small (not important) piece in thier chessboard. I wanted to have more power there I help in the decision making process but I had no idea how to comtribute.
			Thus, I dicided to study.
